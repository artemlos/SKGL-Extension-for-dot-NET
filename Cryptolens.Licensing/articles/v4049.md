# Release notes for v4049

This update comes with GetMachineCodePI when calle with v=2 parameter. It will now fallback on the machineUID that can be extracted from the registry. This applies to Windows only.
This means that when calling this method with v=2, it will return the same value as the Python SDK called with v=2 on Windows.
